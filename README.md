# Frugality to a Fault

I want a streamlined tool for downloading YouTube videos and Twitch VODs so that I can watch/listen on-the-go without costly cell data utilization.

Mobile apps for downloading videos are seedy and low quality and I wish not to pay for YouTube premium.

## Architecture

A basic parameterized Jenkins job will be used to download the video. 

## TODO

Create API and/or some friendly UI in front of Jenkins

Need easy way to get downloads to phone, NAS, etc. Maybe syncthing or Plex. Possibly just a web directory.
